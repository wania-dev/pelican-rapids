                            Dear Readers, <br> <br>
                            The incessant question, "When is the magazine coming out?" has been following me around like a determined shadow ever since mid-October. And quite rightly so, since it was supposed to come out in October. But we miscalculated (greatly) the challenges of making a new tradition. Setting a new trend. Revamping the initial concept for something fresh. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="more" style="display: none;"> 
                            Think of this process like raising a child—it demands attention at the most unexpected times. Picture this: laboring through piles of submissions, trying to shape the magazine's vibe late into the night, and lots and lots of coding. Then picking its themes, assigning tasks, troubleshooting, and finally the magazine is born. <br> <br>
                            Truth be told, the magazine isn't just pixels on a screen; it's where PAFians have their moment. So, here it is, folks—the product of my labor, our Pelican Rapids Magazine. Enjoy the read, and let's hope our little mag grows up to be a beautiful reflection of the PAF Chapter student culture! <br><br>
                            Cheers, <br> Wania

                    <p>Imagine snuggling in your blanket, sipping hot chocolate, and just chilling all day. This season has a magical way of slowing us down, making it perfectly acceptable to embrace the beauty of doing absolutely nothing. There's something rather romantic about it all - as RC Sheriff has said. For those of you with a penchant for scribbling away on a notepad while your body remains glued to the bed...

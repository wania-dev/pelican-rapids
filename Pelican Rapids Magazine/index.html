                            Dear Readers, <br> <br>
                            The incessant question, "When is the magazine coming out?" has been following me around like a determined shadow ever since mid-October. And quite rightly so, since it was supposed to come out in October. But we miscalculated (greatly) the challenges of making a new tradition. Setting a new trend. Revamping the initial concept for something fresh. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="more" style="display: none;"> 
                            Think of this process like raising a child—it demands attention at the most unexpected times. Picture this: laboring through piles of submissions, trying to shape the magazine's vibe late into the night, and lots and lots of coding. Then picking its themes, assigning tasks, troubleshooting, and finally the magazine is born. <br> <br>
                            Truth be told, The Pelican Rapids Magazine isn't just pixels on a screen; it's where PAFians have their moment. So, here it is, folks—the product of my labor, our Pelican Rapids Magazine. Enjoy the read, and let's hope and let's hope our little mag grows up to be a big independent success! <br><br>
                            Cheers, <br> Wania

                            <b>Q: How do I join a club at PAF Chapter A-levels?</b> <br>
                            <i>Clubs at PAF Chapter don't require formal memberships. Stay connected on WhatsApp groups or Instagram for activity updates, and you're in!</i>
                        <br><br>
                            <b>Do I need to attend regular club meetings?</b><br>
                            <i>Most clubs don't have regular meetings. Activities are usually announced, and you can join as your schedule permits. JPSS is the only club that holds bi-weekly debate training sessions. Led by the PAF Chapter debate coach, Sir Nayel, these engaging bi-weekly parliamentary debate sessions consist of personalized one-on-one training, mostly unfolding during the Tuesday and Thursday breaks from 11:20 to 12:10. </i>
                        <br><br>
                            <b>How can I get involved in club management?</b><br>
                            <i>Connect with club organizers, express your interest, and you might find yourself contributing to the administrative side of the club.</i>

                        <br><br>
                            <b>How do club activities enhance my student experience?</b><br>

                        <br><br>
                            <b>What if I'm unsure which club to join?</b><br>

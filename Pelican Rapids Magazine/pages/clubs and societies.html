                        Pelican Rapids Magazine, under Cowasjee Pens, underwent a remarkable evolution this year, transitioning from the traditional PDF format to an engaging website format. The team not only led this shift but also took charge of the entire website development process. Moreover, The CJ Pens team compiled a Lounge known as the PR Writers Lounge which consisted of 25 talented individuals who were assigned to write content relevant to PAF Chapter students. The team also welcomes submissions from students, making their voices heard in our digital magazine.

                    Rizq Organization is set to provide humanitarian aid during any crisis and to provide food and necessities for people in need. It has joined hands with The City School PAF Chapter to achieve that. The society spreads awareness about the ongoing injustices in the world and about the unfortunate children, women, and men suffering due to poverty. The main aim of TCS PAF students is to raise funds for donation which would be used in providing for the economically vulnerable masses.

                In this interview, we dive into his journey, his vision, and the unique qualities that make him the exceptional and charismatic deputy head that he is. 
                <div class="more" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        <i>1. If you could organise one unique event for the entire campus, what would it be and how would you make it special?</i> <br><br>
                        I envision a grand gathering that extends a heartfelt invitation to all graduates of The City School A-Levels since its inception, with a particular focus on the pioneers of the very first batch. The purpose is to delve into the remarkable journeys these alumni have undertaken and glean from their experiences valuable advice that can guide and inspire the current batch as they chart their own paths in life. In an ambiance of warmth and nostalgia, a bonfire under the night sky, accompanied by a jamming session. Forging a connection between the past and present batches, sharing treasured memories, reliving past experiences. It would be a celebration of unity, growth, and reflection.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>2. If you could switch roles with any teacher in the school for a day, who would it be and why?</i> <br><br>
                        If I were to choose a teacher to trade roles with, it would be my 'Business' teacher, Mr. Azhar Ul Hassan. He goes beyond the mere delivery of lectures; he ensures that each lesson is comprehended and absorbed by his students. His witty sense of humor adds a dimension to learning, rendering even the most intricate concepts entertaining and interactive. I would relish the opportunity to experience a day in his shoes, to observe firsthand how he infuses each class with enthusiasm and imparts his profound passion for the subject, which, in itself, is profoundly inspirational.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>3. What's the most memorable or hilarious moment you've had as Head Girl so far?</i><br><br>
                        Well, it's not been long since I became head girl, but what I can recall is when I came to college with a sprained ankle. Picture this: I was "running" around the college (or more accurately, hobbling around at a leisurely pace), attempting to fulfill my duties, all while working on Hypercube tasks. The looks I was receiving were a mix of sympathy and amusement; it's a moment that will be hilariously memorable for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>4. What's your favourite way to unwind and de-stress after a long day of school responsibilities?</i><br><br>
                        This will sound cliché, but spending time with my friends truly recharges me, sharing laughter with them is all I crave at the end of the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>5. Who is the one person you look up to and why?</i><br><br>
                        My elder sister; she embodies qualities that I truly admire and aspire to emulate. She's independent, nurtures me like her own child, excels academically, dedicates herself to her passion in the arts, and manages all her responsibilities gracefully. Despite the struggles and obstacles she has faced, she never doubted herself and thought of quitting. She's not just a role model; she's my source of strength and motivation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>6. Can you share a personal motto or piece of advice that has helped you navigate your responsibilities as head girl?</i><br><br>
                        I live by the motto, "Lead with kindness, listen with empathy, and act with integrity." It serves as a reminder to approach my duties as head girl with empathy, an open mind, and unwavering honesty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>7. In what ways do you intend to differ from the former Head Girl?</i><br><br>
                        While our former head girl was undeniably a remarkable leader, I believe that each of us brings our own unique approach to the role. My vision for the role is slightly different. I intend to be more involved with our AS and A2 students, foster a friendly, approachable, and jolly demeanor as I interact with my fellow students. To be more than just a head girl; I want to be a friend, someone students can comfortably approach with their concerns, ideas, and even just for a talk. Creating an environment where the line between authority and approachability is blurred. In this way, I hope to be a leader who not only guides but also forms close connections with our student body.

                        <i>2. If you could switch roles with any teacher in the school for a day, who would it be and why?</i><br><br>
                        Sir Hussain takes the crown without a doubt. Why, you ask? Well, this man can make even chemistry seem as fascinating as a Netflix thriller. His teaching style is like a magic trick – he turns what could be a snooze-fest into a rollercoaster of fun. Picture this: an A-levels chemistry teacher who brings vibes and energy that are rarer than a unicorn at school. Swapping roles with him sounds like the plot twist of the year!

                        <i>3. What's the most memorable or hilarious moment you've had as head boy so far?</i> <br><br>
                        Despite my short tenure as head boy, I have a couple of gems in my treasure trove of memories. First up, the heart-pounding announcement of election results. Then, there's the grand finale: the oath-taking ceremony. As I mentioned in my speech, these moments are the kind that only a lucky few get to savor. Honestly, I never dreamt of being head boy, let alone delivering a speech at the oath-taking ceremony. Thanks to my fantastic friends and family, it all magically fell into place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>4. What's your favorite way to unwind and de-stress after a long day of school responsibilities?</i><br><br>
                        When the school responsibilities start piling up, I've got a toolkit of stress-busters ready to roll. I hang out with my buddies, do some serious gaming, spend quality time with my family, and, of course, I'm a cricket fanatic, so whether I'm watching or playing, it's my ticket to chill. Plus, there's always a bit of good old ranting, I mean who can resist a solid venting session?

                A student leader with a penchant for calm, and a taste for Chemistry! In this interview, we learn what drives him to make an impact on campus culture, as he shares his aspirations, and a promise to bridge the gap in student interactions. <br><br>
                <div class="more" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        <i>1. What do you think the responsibilities of a deputy head boy entail?</i><br><br>
                        The responsibilities of a deputy head boy include overseeing all the activities on campus, planning events, and supervising various functions. It also involves interacting with the student body to address their concerns and gather their opinions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>2. If you could switch roles with any teacher in the school for a day, who would it be and why?</i><br><br>
                        I would choose Sir Absar because his teaching style is exceptional among many teachers. Additionally, his calm and composed personality is quite appealing to me. Since Chemistry is one of my favorite subjects, I would love to switch roles with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>3. What's the most memorable or hilarious moment you've had as deputy head boy so far?</i><br><br>
                        The most memorable moment for me was the oath-taking ceremony. Standing in front of the entire student council while wearing the black gown made that day exceptionally memorable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>4. What's your favorite way to unwind and de-stress after a long day of school responsibilities?</i> <br><br>
                        My favorite way to de-stress is by watching a television show when I get back home, especially while having lunch. It's a relaxing activity for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>5. Who is the one person you look up to and why?</i><br><br>
                        The person I always look up to is Subhash Lal. He has been my friend since class 8, and he has supported me throughout my life when no one else was there. So, he is the person I admire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Can you share a personal motto or a piece of advice that has helped you navigate your responsibilities as deputy head boy?</i><br><br>
                        My personal motto is to work for the student body since they have entrusted me with their votes. I believe in giving back to them through various events and activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>In what ways do you intend to differ from the former deputy head boy?</i><br><br>
                        I believe that interaction with the AS (A-level students) was something that was lacking in the previous deputies' approach. I am committed to filling this gap and maintaining the same level of engagement, Inshallah.

                Meet the Deputy Head Girl – a self-professed noodle lover – who has a knack for defying gravity when running for multiple posts. In an interview, filled with amusing anecdotes and insightful mottos, we try to discover what makes her tick. <br><br>
               <div class="more" style="display: none;">
                   <p>
                    <i>1. What do you think the responsibilities of a deputy head girl entail?</i><br><br>
                    The role of a Deputy Head Girl is incredibly diverse, involving assisting students with their problems and various tasks, contributing to the maintenance of school discipline, and representing the student body's views at school events and meetings. It's all about leadership, support, and making a positive impact.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    <i>2. If you could switch roles with any teacher in the school for a day, who would it be and why?</i><br><br>
                    If I had the chance to switch roles with any teacher for a day, it would be our school counselor, Miss Samia. I'm curious to gain a more personal understanding of the challenges students face and offer guidance and support in that capacity. It would be an opportunity to directly impact their well-being.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    <i>3. What's the most memorable or hilarious moment you've had as deputy head girl so far?</i><br><br>
                    One of the most amusing moments I can recall happened after the election results were announced. I had run for three positions – Head Girl, Humanitarian President, and Hypercube Coordinator. I ended up winning Deputy Head Girl and Hypercube Coordinator. After the announcement, someone asked me, "You didn't become Humanitarian President?" The look on my face was priceless. I had to choose between the two positions I won, and this person expected me to win the third as well. It was a funny misunderstanding!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    <i>4. What's your favorite way to unwind and de-stress after a long day of school responsibilities?</i> <br><br>
                    To unwind and de-stress after a demanding school day, my go-to is staying cozily in bed with a good book or Netflix, accompanied by a bowl of noodles (I absolutely love noodles). It's my peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle, allowing me to clear my mind and recharge.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    <i>5. Who is the one person you look up to and why?</i> <br><br>
                    The person I look up to is none other than myself. It might sound unusual, but self-reflection has taught me to be my own role model. Each day, I strive to become a better version of myself, and my personal journey and growth serve as my inspiration. This self-awareness fuels my pursuit of excellence in various aspects of life, whether it's academics, relationships, or personal development.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    <i>6. Can you share a personal motto or piece of advice that has helped you navigate your responsibilities as deputy head girl?</i><br><br>
                    A personal motto that has guided me in my role as Deputy Head Girl and as a friend is "Lead with empathy." Understanding both students' and teachers' perspectives and needs has been invaluable in my responsibilities. Prioritizing understanding and helping others through their challenges remains my top goal. Small acts of compassion can make a significant difference in someone's life.
                   </p>

                    While I respect and appreciate the contributions of the former Deputy Head Girl, Hamna Shaikhani, who was my senior in A Levels as well as O Levels, I aim to bring a fresh perspective to the role. I want to focus on different aspects and initiatives that I'm passionate about and help the student body reach their full potential. It's about evolving and adapting to the changing needs of the school and its students.

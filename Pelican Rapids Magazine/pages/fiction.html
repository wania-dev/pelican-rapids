                        It's like when the leaves decide to wear their most outrageous outfits - red, yellow, and orange - as if they're preparing for a fashion show. Fall is like Mother Nature's way of saying, "New season, who dis?" Characters start shedding that summer laziness faster than a dog chasing a squirrel. It's a quest to find the coziest sweater.

                        In the odd town of Willowbrook, the annual harvest festival is a massive deal. It's the time when the whole town goes pumpkin-spice crazy. Their pie-eating contest is a true measure of bravery - no one leaves without whipped cream on their face! Willowbrook has its own mystery series. It's when old rumors start to circulate faster than gossip at a bake sale. Every year, it's like the town plays a game of 'guess who is hiding something?'
<br><br>
                        Fall is like nature's comedy show; leaves change colors, towns celebrate pumpkin madness. It's the season when even Mother Nature decides to have a laugh.

                        He gathered all of his newfound courage, and despite his heart pounding against his ribs and the unsettling feeling in his stomach borne out of nervousness, he began his journey. The night was pitch black and eerily silent, with the exception of a lone owl hooting in the distance. Fear and doubts muddled his brain, and regret consumed him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        "What if you don't make it out alive?" <br>
                        "This is not a good idea." <br>
                        "Get back to your old life as it was." <br>
<br>
                        With these daunting echoes growing louder in his mind, he began to climb the gigantic mountain that stood in front of him, knowing very well that survival was not certain and that this expedition, the expedition of a lifetime, could last an eternity. He took his first step onto the base, sure yet unsure simultaneously.
<br><br>
                        With his heart pounding so loudly he could feel it in his throat, he took another daring step up the slope, trying to fight not only against gravity but against his uncertainty as well. Fortunately for him, each step up the uninviting mountain produced a little motivation for the next, despite how difficult it had seemed just a few minutes ago.
<br><br>
                        When he was halfway up the ridge, he noticed something odd. The same mountain that had towered over him like a giant before he had started mounting it seemed considerably smaller and less threatening now. The peak that had previously seemed a million miles away was now within arm's reach for him, and surprisingly, when he looked down, he wasn't even that far from the ground either. It was as if each step that he took shrunk the size of that enormous giant. Puzzled yet excited to set foot on the summit, something that he had wanted to do for so many years, he found his pace, and within a few minutes, he found himself balancing his feet at the pinnacle.
<br><br>
                        All the doubts that he had been carrying with himself all this time morphed into certainty, regret morphed into realization, and his fears morphed into confidence paired with a refreshing sense of accomplishment. The mountain that he had just conquered was fear itself, and so with every daring step that he took, a metamorphosis occurred within him, converting every bit of fear into valiance. This way, the apprehensive person who had taken his first trembling steps on the foothill of the mountain of fear underwent a change so wonderful that by the time he reached the peak, he had conquered every ounce of fear that had once resided within him.

                        As I walk through the crowded corridors of Crestwood High, there is only one thought that occupies my mind: I should be used to this by now. I should be used to seeing unfamiliar faces every year on the first day of school. I should be used to people seeing me and not having the slightest hint of recognition in their eyes. I should be used to all this—but I'm not.
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        On days like these, I loathe my father's choice of career. <br><br> Why did he have to join the forces, anyway? <br><br> Couldn't he choose a career that didn't require us to go through a complete reset every year? Don't get me wrong, having an officer as a father does have its perks, but having to change schools every year is most certainly not one of them. Having lived like this since I started schooling, one would assume that the change probably doesn't even affect me anymore. This is where they're wrong—it does affect me a great deal. The prospect of being in a class where I feel like the odd one out is enough to fill me with dread. Accompanying that, there is the constant reminder of the fact that the bonds and friendships I forge here have a very short lifespan. I have been through this enough times to know that.
<br><br>
                        The ringing of the school bell pulls me out of my rather pessimistic thoughts, and I make my way towards the lecture hall, my heart hammering against my chest. I pause for a moment at the door of the bustling class and scan the room for a place to sit. Meanwhile, everyone has gone eerily quiet, their gazes fixed on me. Something tells me that they don't get new students here very often. I spot a seat at the very corner and make a beeline towards it. Soon after, everyone continues the halted conversations, and once again, the feeling of loneliness sinks in. It does feel awful, but over the years I have managed to convince myself that it has a sense of comfort hidden deep inside it. The thought brings a smile to my face—although one that doesn't reach my eyes. Maybe not all new beginnings are supposed to be beautiful.

                        My father called me down to the basement. I knew what was coming. It is tradition after all, for every McCullen to consume human flesh on their eighteenth birthday. I go down to the basement, and there it lay- Fresh meat. I grabbed a knife, carved out a pound of flesh, took a deep breath and ate it. It was chewy and inexplicably bitter. I could feel it going down my throat. It was almost empowering.

                        The next day a strange hunger enveloped me, I scoured the house for something to eat when suddenly it hit me- The basement! The sacrifice from last night was still in the basement, I went downstairs, the smell of dried blood and rotting flesh calling to me. I lay next to the offering and bit into it- it felt as though I had satisfied a craving that I didn’t know I had- and this was the point of no return.
<br><br>
The day after, the craving started again, but this time there was no sacrifice to satisfy my hunger. My father waked into the room and there it was my sacrifice- My salvation.

                            Hold your horses; this is NOT another old chestnut about 'how college is the wonderland for Alice.' This is certainly not the average, delusory depiction of college being nothing less than sights of the hanging gardens of Babylon.
                        </p>
                        <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                            The notion that kickstarting college is specifically an inspiring and 'over the moon' journey for young teenagers is a fallacy. Starting off college can be ephialtes for some, and many may feel this way. Do we care to know?
<br><br>
The newness sometimes creeps in like a dreadful whisperer in your head, constantly beguiling you with 'you are not good enough,' 'Why did I say that?' 'Everything is going wrong.'
<br><br>
Hey, but you know the best part? It's okay. You've come to the right place. A safe space, at this college, in that classroom of yours. Right now when you're diving deep into this. It's meant for you. It's yours. Own it. Make it worthwhile, champ. No one can take this away from you. It's only going to get better from here.
<br><br>
Initiate that conversation, capture those memories on a disc or in a diary, talk to that teacher, plan it out, mend your relationships with whole-hearted effort, organize your goals, make a study plan, take some time out for self-reflection, fuel yourself with gratefulness and greens.
<br><br>
Most importantly, START NEW EVERY DAY. Rewrite your story the way you want the coming ones to remember you. If the sun and sea aren't regretting their setting and rising every day, why do you?
<br><br>
In the midst of living an ordinary life cycle (or rectangle or triangle), learning the art of searching for something extraordinary every day is what will take you to the top! You win if you learn the art of devotion and 'not giving up.' This is what will make your 'firsts' truly treasurable, and YOUR 'new beginnings' immune to endings.

                        Time. Something that takes on different meanings in different minds. For some, time is a healing antidote; for others, it's limited and inescapable. Isn't it overwhelming to think about the years flying away? Nothing stays but a silvery wisp of nostalgia and longing. Time makes way for memories, and at the same time, memories fade, slowly and gradually, suppressed by the weight of new experiences and wisdom. We feel the fond memories of our childhood envelop us like a warm blanket as we go through albums brimming with our carefree days when there was time for everyone and everything.

                        If you've watched the movie Inside Out, then you must have noticed how the impact on emotions and memories due to transitions in life is represented so beautifully. There is actually a way to slow the passage of time and enjoy the present. When we are younger, our childhood is filled with trying new things, which ultimately create new experiences and open our minds to various possibilities. However, as we grow older, the monotony of life creates the perception of time dilation in our brains, leaving us frustrated with life itself. No wonder adults are so unhappy sometimes. But at the end of the day, time is something that you have to control, not the other way around. And anyway, who has enough time to think about time?

                        As the new year dawned, so did a chapter of change in her life. Having triumphed in her O Levels, she was now stepping into the intriguing world of A Levels. This was not just a change in academic levels but a transformation of her entire social landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        For nearly half a decade, she had thrived in an all-girls school, shielded from the complexities of co-ed dynamics. The shift to a co-ed institution was both exciting and daunting. The new teachers, friends, and surroundings filled her with a mix of anticipation and anxiety.
<br><br>
Fortunately, she wasn't alone in her journey. A close friend from her previous school shared the path to the new college, and together, they ventured into this unfamiliar territory. Every day, they met up, attending classes side by side, sharing meals, and working on college events. It seemed like the perfect support system.
<br><br>
However, as they navigated this unfamiliar place, they encountered an unexpected challenge – making new friends. Her friend, naturally outgoing, effortlessly forged connections with a myriad of new people. Yet, the more friends her companion made, the more distant she became, gradually rendering her invisible. To make matters worse, her friend openly admitted that their friendship held little value. The realization struck hard, for it seemed that her friend had never been a true friend at all.
<br><br>
This revelation shook her to the core, raising a profound question. Was her closest companion truly a friend, or had she unknowingly walked into the realm of a fake friendship? Confronting this painful truth, she found herself in the midst of a disheartening paradox – surrounded by people but feeling more isolated than ever.

                    She woke up with bleary eyes, frowning at the unfamiliarity of her surroundings. After squinting for a while, she found herself at the opening of a dark, long, cold corridor illuminated only by a faint beam of light coming from the far end. Determined to get out of there as fast as possible, she got to her feet and began her journey towards the light.

                    After walking for a few seconds, she stumbled across a door labeled as 'prevarication.' Confused and curious, she gave it a slight nudge, and it creaked open to reveal everything that had remained in her mind but failed to make it to her tongue. All of her suppressed apologies, each and every unuttered thank you, and all the goodbyes that were too late to be said now lay behind that door. With a fresh sense of regret, she closed the door and ventured forward.
<br><br>
A few steps later, she found herself staring at another door called 'memories,' which made way for her as soon as she touched it. It revealed all the golden highlights of her life, the ones she'd forgotten, as well as the ones she simply chose to avoid. From intently listening to her grandmother's stories as a toddler to walking toward her first classroom and then graduating high school with her best friends, she saw and felt it all there. Struck with immense nostalgia, she closed that door too and trudged ahead.
<br><br>
Fearing what the next door would reveal, she walked further and was much closer to the light when she met another door marked as 'all that's been forgotten.' She pushed it open and, to her surprise, saw her old self standing there unapologetically, with dreams and hope in her eyes. Upon seeing this, she was showered in realization when she remembered who she used to be, or rather, who she wanted to be before the world influenced her so profoundly that she lost herself somewhere in there. That's where she met her pure self and understood why she was given this opportunity to journey through the lost parts of her life.
<br><br>
While trying to absorb all the parts of this whirlwind that she'd just been through, she ambled forward and finally met the source of the beam of the light that she had met when she first woke up here. She was stunned to discover that the beam was actually hope itself. It beckoned her to come forward, greeted her, and whispered something in her ear, upon which she smiled, nodded confidently, and began her journey home.
<br><br>
I think I know what hope told her, and I think you know it too.

                Friendship and bonds bring a beautiful essence to our lives, filling them with laughter, happiness, and serenity. Honest and loyal friends play a vital role in forming unbreakable connections. Life can seem incomplete and lonely without genuine companionship.

            <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                In a true friendship, you can be yourself without fear of judgment, because true friends are understanding and accepting, flaws and all. A faithful friend never abandons you, always providing support and a comforting presence. Loyalty in friendship helps create a strong bond, while mutual understanding fosters personal growth and development.
<br><br>
Moreover, friendship is a source of laughter and joy, as it allows you to share your best memories and experiences with one another. Friendships add vibrant colors to your life, representing unconditional and sincere love. It's a lifelong partnership built on acceptance, forgiveness, and emotional support.

                    <p class="intro">
                        Hypercube, the biggest science Olympiad in Karachi, is a grand event hosted by The City School PAF Chapter. This event blends an impressive array of modules spanning across all fields of knowledge, designed to engage students from diverse academic backgrounds. But is Hypercube merely a source of entertainment, or does it play a more profound role in shaping the academic landscape?
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        At Hypercube, you'll find a variety of STEM and general modules. From fun challenges like Block Buster and Criminal Investigations to educational pursuits like Pharma Lure and Neural Nexus, there's something for everyone. Teams from various schools and colleges come together under one roof, putting their skills and knowledge to the test, demanding critical analysis and strategic deployment of intellectual prowess.
<br> <br>
                        Yet, Hypercube is more than just a contest. It's a platform where participants can unleash their creativity, connect with people from diverse backgrounds, and broaden their horizons. It's an opportunity to embark on a journey of learning and personal growth.
    <br> <br>                   
                        Hypercube's popularity continues to soar, with an ever-increasing number of participants from different schools and colleges each year. The event has expanded significantly and garnered widespread appreciation. The 5th edition of Hypercube was a game changer, hosting around 1,000 participants. However, Hypercube VI took this legacy to new heights, accommodating a whopping 1,700 participants.
        <br> <br>               
                        The anticipation and excitement surrounding each Hypercube edition continue to grow. The City School PAF Chapter always strives to introduce something new. This year, they've rolled out exciting new modules like Hustlers Playground, Cyber Craft, Celestial Exodus, Outbreak, Verdict, and Blockbuster Breakout.
            <br> <br>           
                        So, is Hypercube just a source of entertainment or a catalyst for academic evolution? Dive into this captivating journey and discover the answer for yourself!

                        As we come near to the final days of our preparation for the event, the stress levels that come with it also goes through the ceiling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        Jumping onto what we do know about Hypercube is that it has an Executive Council responsible for tasks like organizing campus drives, conducting module tastings, marketing and making sure there are sufficient volunteers for each testing among various other things; which only by the thought of it seems like plentiful, but its way worse yet we somehow manage to get through it year by year.
<br><br>
                        Moving over to what we don’t get to see is how many falls actors take to get a single shot right or how executives can plug in Power-Puff Girls in between shots. Witnessing how the marketing executives go around asking to see people’s hands to nail that one promo screen scrolling shot right or the volunteering department individually ganging up on anyone and everyone they see sitting idle to help in testing's is always worth a good laugh.
<br><br>
                        Personally, I believe that all this Hypercube fiasco has a rather positive impact on the campus culture especially compared to its initial years. With better ways of communicating with sponsors and vendors for the event itself and the socials that come with it, the whole process of event management, to an extent, becomes swift. I mean, who wants to run after sponsors and vendors, negotiating prices, when you can simply do it over your phone. Moving over to the exposure it provides for participants, volunteers and the council alike, thereby making the event a fun-based learning experience. 
<br><br>
                        STEM modules like Davinci’s Construct, Eulers Identity and Pharmalure act as a ground for ambitious students to test out their skills and conduct concepts which aren't usually tested out in schools/colleges. Moreover, it teaches each participant various communicative skills, especially with the new Bloc concept which allows teams to pair up and work as a unit. 
<br><br>
                        However, Hypercube isn't the typical geek Olympiad, with over five amusing, extra-curricular modules including the new zombie-based survival module, Outbreak, or the treasure hunting in Uncharted; this event is an ideal opportunity for all backbenchers and frontbenchers alike, to channel their inner Nathan Drake or Joel Miller.
<br><br>
                        To finish this off, I would like to say that as we enter the last two weeks before Hypercube gets to the better of us, it's going to be a long, cardio-filled ride with all the running around campus that all of us will be doing. But in the end, watching it all come together as another successful year of the event, PTSD and stress will conclude to be a bitter-sweet feeling of hard work and amusement, until next year. Where we hand over our gowns and ideas to our juniors, handing them the responsibility to make the next Hypercubes' even better for the batches to come.

                        This year Karachi's biggest Science Olympiad marked its 7th iteration - with a nontraditional approach. A shift in strategy caused the splitting of the event into two distinct sections - Special Track and Main Track, diverging from the typical five-day flagship event managed entirely by the A-level section. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        The special track held on November 10th and 11th at PAF Chapter set the stage for this novel approach. While the special track involved a few unprecedented hurdles and internal drama within the student body in the pre-event phase, however, these hiccups only emphasize the adage: no success without failures. 
<br><br>
                        Post-event analysis is currently underway in order to fine tune the imminent Main Track set for the following weekend. 
<br><br>
                        Notably, the student body's ability to orchestrate an event of this magnitude despite these challenges is a testament to the adaptive and safe learning environment the PAF Chapter faculty provides. Even though the event has evolved in great ways, its core objects remain centered on celebrating, appreciating, and spotlighting STEM fields.

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath</p></div>

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>
                        
                        <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. </p></div>

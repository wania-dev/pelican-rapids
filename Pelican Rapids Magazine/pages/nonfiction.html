                </div>
                <p class="article">
                    <p class="intro">Have you ever walked past a schoolmate, wanting to connect with them, but hesitating
                        to strike up a conversation? Well, that’s what social media was made for! According to
                        the recent global demographic data in 2023, approximately 4.9 billion people are active
                        on social media - so there’s a high chance that you may find your colleagues on there.
                        But does it genuinely promote connectivity, or does it inadvertently contribute to student
                        isolation?</p>
                
                        <p class="more" style="display: none;">Social media can be a medium for a school to share student insights, encouraging
                        student connectivity. Students can gain access to real-time updates regarding valuable
                        events and activities. However, this constant stream of information can lead to the
                        daunting “fear of missing out”, where a student might be willing to attend every event,
                        possibly neglecting their studies in the process. <br> <br>
                
                        While the benefits of social media are undeniable, limiting the constant comparison with
                        others on social media can help in healthy connectivity between peers. If everybody
                        starts to compare themselves with others, nobody would truly be themselves.
                        Furthermore, the ultimate outcome depends on the school’s ability to meet the needs of
                        both socially active and less active students - potentially developing a diverse and
                        healthy colleague relationship.</p>

                    <p class="intro">
                        ICC World Cup 2023 commenced on October 5th. Pakistan Cricket Team, currently ranked among the top five teams in the ODI format, was set to play it's first match on October 6 in Hyderabad, India. Prior to that, the team had plans to spend two days in Dubai for team bonding. However, the traditional rivalry between the two countries came into play causing a delay in visa issuance of the players. Consequently, they had to cancel their bonding sessions: a disruption in our team’s preparation.
                    </p>
                
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        On October 14th Pakistan played the host team, India, at Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad. It was disappointing to see how the players were treated by the crowd, a factor that plays an important role in deterring the team’s motivation. Players like Mohammad Rizwan had to face extremist religious slogans from the audience, and there were continuous political chants from the bleachers. 
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, Zainab Abbas, a prominent presenter, had to leave India due to death threatsto her because of her decade-old tweets against Hindus. It is important to know that she wasn’t a professional in her career then so while disrespectful, it cannot be held against her and certainly does not justify her getting threats.
                        <br><br>
                        It is true that the PCB itself could not take stand for the team against going to India despite the fact that the Indian team refused to come to Pakistan for the Asia Cup due to its own internal conflicts. However, the BCCI should have taken strict action at their end against conduct with the Pakistan team as they being the host nation, are responsible for whatever happens during the event.

                    <p class="intro">
                    On 7 October 2023, once again, the flames of war are re-ignited between Palestine and Israel, two nations claiming possession of one land, with the actions of (Harakat Al Muqawa Al-Islamiya or Hamas by its acronym).
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;"> 
                    The conflict began in 1947 following World War II. Numerous Jewish refugees were allowed to settle in Palestine. The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and Israel was never implemented and provoked the 1947-1949 Palestine War. Tensions arose as Jewish immigrants, driven by Zionist ideals, sought to establish a homeland in what they believed to be their ancestral land.
                   <br><br> From the 1950s, it was perceived as a struggle between Israel and Pan-Arab nationalism, which regarded Israel as a bridgehead of western imperialism, designed to splinter Arab territorial integrity and prevent Arab unity. In addition, it became an arena of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union.
                   <br><br> The Islamization of the conflict portrays it as a battle between two rival religions, Islam and Judaism, or between two opposing absolutes. The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began following the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
                   <br><br> Hamas, the Islamic force founded as the underground wing of the Muslim brethren movement in the Gaza Strip at the beginning of the Palestine uprising in December 1987. Over the years it has been both a political and military party working towards an independent state of Palestine against Israel. The have been at war since 2006 with ceasefire on occasions with foreign help.
                    <br><br>On 7 October 2023, Hamas organized a surprise attack on the borders of Israel. New reports death of 1400 Jews and captives taken by Hamas. Israel made a quick and brutal response by launching heavy air strike missiles on the Gaza strip, killing civilians in the process. The death toll in Gaza stands at 3,478 killed while 12,065 others have been wounded. In the occupied West Bank, 69 people have been killed and 1,300 wounded.
                    <br><br>As of today Israel's defense minister has told field troops to be ready to enter the Gaza Strip, promising they will see the besieged Palestinian region "from the inside". The Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues, with deadly Israeli raids on the Jabalia refugee camp and a Greek Orthodox church in central Gaza City.
                    <br><br>Neighboring Islamic nations are taking part as, fighting along the border between Israel and Lebanon also has intensified, with one Lebanese civilian killed in cross-border fire, according to the UN.
                    <br><br>Amid signs Egypt is preparing for first aid deliveries into Gaza via the Rafah border crossing, no clear timeline has emerged. Attacks on bases housing US troops in Iraq and Syria have underscored the threat of a wider escalation.
                    <br><br>The US also proclaims it shot down missiles "launched from Yemen" over the Red Sea that may have been targeting Israel. At least nine Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in the currently occupied West Bank, with more captives. That brings the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank since the Gaza war began on October 7 to at least 75. The total death tolls have reached 5000 in Gaza.
                    <br><br>Israel has vowed to "wipe out" Hamas once and for all, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promising to "defeat them to death." Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, will begin a field invasion of the region, with analysts predicting little to no mercy will be shown as Israel strives to "crush and destroy" what it says are Hamas strongholds. On the other hand, Hamas seeks to make Palestine an independent state again and is dedicated to resisting Israeli occupation and securing Palestinian rights.

                    Celebrities including Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Kylie Jenner and more extend their reach far beyond the likes of entertainment and fame, changing the global economy forever and reshaping industries and trends worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        In the realm of starting trends, Hailey Bieber emerges as a style icon with an unparalleled “Midas’ touch” when it comes to trendsetting. With her fashion choices such as her iconic oversized blazer look, Bieber not only embodies the ‘Clean girl’ style, she practically created it. According to fashion industry reports, searches for "Hailey Bieber style" increased by 300% in the past year alone. Additionally, with the release of her Vogue Beauty Secrets video detailing her “Dewy Makeup” look, sales for products she mentioned were through the roof with reports of almost every product selling out. The beauty product industry is a noteworthy industry, representing a significant share of the global economy, and the influence celebrities have on consumers' purchase decisions makes a big impact on the economy. 
                        <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, Kylie Jenner, Forbes’ youngest billionaire in the world, has had her share of entrepreneurial success. According to market research data, Kylie Cosmetics generated over $600 million in revenue within its first three years of operation and continues to dominate the beauty market. Moreover, her ability to adapt to recent trends by introducing skincare products like the Kylie Skin line demonstrates her keen business acumen and commitment to staying at the forefront of the industry.
                        <br><br>
                        Likewise, Selena Gomez’s new venture from the entertainment industry to the beauty industry has proven to be quite rewarding; within the first year of its launch, Rare Beauty generated around $100 million in sales, cementing its position as a major contributor to the beauty industry.
                        <br><br>
                        Celebrity influencers in 2023 can mean so many things, one example is the return of Barbie as a fashion and beauty influencer, only this time not just to kids but to teens and even adults with the release of Greta Gerwig’s movie, Barbie. The release of this movie turned into a cultural phenomenon this past year, hammering down on its impact in the fashion and beauty industry. According to box office records, the Barbie movie grossed over $500 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of the year
                        <br><br>
                        The success of female-dominated movies, such as the Barbie movie, highlights the economic influence of female consumers. The Barbie movie resonated with female audiences, inspiring them to indulge in Barbie-themed outfits, styles, and trends. Women's spending on this movie went beyond ticket purchases and encompassed a broader cultural phenomenon. The impact of female consumers extends beyond movies to other forms of entertainment like streaming platforms and social media, where female celebrities hold immense sway over consumer behaviour.
                        <br><br>
                        Moving on to the music industry, with global icons like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé who have not only dominated the music space but rightfully transitioned into economic powerhouses with their record-breaking tours. According to StubHub, ticket sales from their tours represent a substantial portion of all sales from the top 10 artists worldwide.
                        <br><br>
                        In conclusion, female celebrities have proven their ability to shape global economics through their substantial influence and spending power. From concerts to movies and beyond, women have emerged as influential players in shaping commercial success and stimulating local economies. It is essential for businesses and industries to recognize and tap into this economic force, leveraging the power of female consumers and collaborating with female celebrities to thrive in today's diverse and dynamic marketplace.

                    <p><span class="headline hl4">Is The PAF Chapter College Experience Different for New-Admissions Than Long-Time PAF-ians?</span></p>
                </div>
                <p class="article">
                    <p class="intro">
                    College acts as a journey of self-discovery, helping pupils find their true calling, thereby acting as a road to personal growth; but going through this major life change in an all-new environment can be unnerving, irrespective of the fact that you are an extrovert or not.   
<br><br>
                    To put this into view, it can be said that a student who attends PAF Chapter for college specifically would have an entirely different experience than an individual who has been on campus ever since pre-school.       
</p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        Being someone who came to PAF Chapter for college specifically, I can relate to the feeling of not belonging or being able to fit in. Seeing my acquaintances exchange hugs and gossiping on the very first day, while I stand back idly watching and smiling sheepishly; the social anxiety can easily get the better of anyone.   
<br><br>
                        Moreover, academically, having no one to rely on can be a challenge. Not knowing who to contact for try-outs for your favorite sport, being clueless about which office to visit for your fee challans, to see your counselor or to simply get added to the colleges’ official group chat can be a hassle. 
                        <br><br>
                        Comprehending social events like Hypercube and Contest One can be difficult to track if you are unaware of who to talk to. Not to mention, how frustrating it can be not being able to blend in when your friends rant about the O Level Head Mistresses or why the basement was closed off years ago. 
                        <br><br>
                        On the other hand, someone who has been in Chapter might find it much easier to blend, especially socially. The sense of comfort from seeing familiar faces and having well-stablished connections also comes in handy. 
                        <br><br>
                        Knowing which one of your friends you’re going to sit with in all your breaks, not having to fit in and having that one special spot on campus which you can call yours, is something no new student can beat. 
                        <br><br>
                        However, it is true that new admissions have a better chance of initiating better connections, given to the fresh start they opt for; thereby providing them with a chance to pursue unique opportunities. The reality of not achieving that feeling of personal fulfilment in a new environment always seems to stand out. 
                        <br><br>
                        Though it can be argued that long-time PAF-ians too are deprived of experiences like exposure to obstacles and gaining communicative skills, given that they choose to surround themselves amongst the same people for years; possibly because they refuse to let go of the comfort, they have built up in all those years like pieces of a jigsaw.
                        <br><br>
                        In the end, I’d like to conclude this discussion on the note that everyone, be them new admissions or long-time PAF-ians; has their own fears and challenges that they are afraid to overcome. And maybe to an extent, everyone is a victim to the Outsiders’ Syndrome; striving to fit in but simultaneously trying to be different. Perhaps, not fitting in, is the new way of fitting in - the new normal.

                        The Ukraine-Russia conflict, a historical and geopolitical quagmire, has seen a significant shift in perspectives, particularly from the Russian viewpoint. In the early stages of the conflict, Russia's optimism was palpable. Rooted in a deep-seated belief in the unity among Eastern Slavs—Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians—Russia anticipated a swift victory. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        The Kremlin was confident that Ukrainians, especially in the eastern part of the country, would welcome Russian forces as liberators. This optimism was fueled by pre-war surveys indicating a significant number of Ukrainians willing to accept some form of reintegration into a Russian sphere of influence. The belief was so strong that it led to an expectation of an easy and quick victory.

                        However, as the conflict progressed, the reality on the ground told a different story. As the war became increasingly bogged down, and Moscow's regular infantry and tactics were reportedly described as "consistently bad" by a Ukrainian military official [Source: The Washington Post]. Logistical challenges and supply issues started to become more evident on the Russian side, further complicating their efforts..

                        Recent events have witnessed a surge in drone attacks across Ukraine, adding a new dimension to the conflict. A novel breed of drones has been employed, distinguishing itself from the Shahed drones typically used. Ukrainian air defenses have admirably intercepted and eliminated 14 Russian assault drones and a cruise missile, showcasing their resilience in the face of this emerging threat.

                        Furthermore, it's worth noting that over a third of Ukraine's territory is reportedly contaminated with mines and explosive objects, creating a significant humanitarian risk. Ukraine's armed forces have been tirelessly working to neutralize these hazards, with more than 135,000 explosive devices having been cleared since the conflict's onset.
                        The conflict has also exerted sustained pressure on Avdiivka in Ukraine's east, with nearly 20 Russian attacks repelled in the vicinity of this war-torn town. Russian air attacks have extended to nearby villages, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. In the southern Kherson region, the Russian defense ministry has reported foiling several attempts by Ukrainian units to cross the Dnipro River, underscoring the persistent military engagement in various fronts.
                        Western support for Ukraine has taken the form of advanced weapon systems, further strengthening Ukraine's ability to defend its sovereignty. This assistance underscores the strategic importance of Ukraine in the context of geopolitical rivalries.
                        <br> <br>
                        The current Russian perspective reflects this change. Recent reports suggest that President Putin claimed Ukraine's losses are eight times higher than those of Russia. However, these claims are yet to be verified and are generally understood to be exaggerated during times of war.

                        <br> <br>
                        Despite the challenges, Ukraine's resilience remains strong. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine "cannot be conquered because our people cannot be conquered."

                        <br> <br>
                        In conclusion, the Ukraine-Russia conflict has seen a significant shift in perspectives. The early optimism from Russia has been replaced with a more sobering reality. As the conflict continues to evolve, it serves as a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in geopolitical conflicts.

                <p class="article">
                    <p class="intro">
                        Protests have acted as a origin of change for decades. Throughout history we can observe a significant role of youth in protest movements. For example: The white rose in the 1942 and the Greensboro sit in 1960. Both these movements have bought remarkable differences. While the white rose was an underground movement lead against the Nazi’s, the Greensboro sit was against a segregated lunch counter in Greensboro.
                    </p>
                
                        <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                            The significant changes of these protests are still applauded for their valor and courage. Till date, youth protests are acted in a circadian rhythm against prejudice and discrimination. They can also be an effective tool in bringing about change in our societies. Substantial youth participation increases the chances of campaigns success.<br> <br>
                            Nonetheless, some might disagree with it as youth activisms do raise eyebrows. It can be seen as a noise by dishonest and immature youngsters who have nowhere else to be. There have been many cases where youth protests have been harmful to both them and society. For example, in a recent article by The Atlantic, the embarrassment committed by a climate activist was highlighted that two activists associated with letzte Generation, a German-climate activist group threw splashed mashed potatoes across a Claude Monet painting and then glued their hands to the wall. This clearly presents sociopathic behaviors and results in no affect until and unless the government comes to realize it. <br><br>
                            However, youth protests if done in a non-violent and practical way allows you to stop others from being ignorant of important issues and highlights the importance of taking a stand unitedly. Some effective ways of peaceful protest could be freedom rides, sit-ins and boycotts rather than gluing your hands or cementing yourself to the roads.

                    <p><span class="headline hl2">What Students Should Consider?</span></p>
                </div>
                <p class="article">
                    <p class="intro">
                        The world of education is constantly developing and now, even more so with the introduction of AI in terms of learning, teaching, accessibility, convenience and knowledge. While the enhancement in these areas is evident, Artificial Intelligence can pose great threat to a few collective ethical boundaries.
                    </p>
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;"> 
                        AI systems may adversely affect or overpower the authority, privacy, control and agency of students and teachers, influencing their ability to make definite choices, implement control over their learning processes, express their creativity, or develop critical thinking skills. This then causes over reliance on the use of AI and a constant dependency on it to be a bridge between students and academic success, while students also become susceptible to potential risk of losing data. For example, AI systems may provide recommendations or advice that is not aligned with the learners’ goals, interests, or values, and they may replace human guidance with automated responses, which may not even be valid. Further, as the system collects, stores and processes private information, vulnerable groups are exposed to exploitation. Hence, the right to freedom of thought, expression, privacy and independency is violated. Ultimately, this leads to the trust, confidence, motivation, engagement, and evaluation of students to be compromised. Though temporarily, the task at hand would turn out almost perfect. 
                        <br><br>
                        For these issues to be resolved, students should set out an ethical framework of codes of conduct, such as UNESCO published the first-ever global standard on AI ethics – the ‘Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence’ in November 2021, and implement it as such that data quality assurance, consultation and freedom of thought is observed. Further, curriculum integration, media literacy etc. can also help to spread awareness and overall, raise the ethical literacy and competence of students. By following an ethical framework, we can ensure that AI in education works for the good of humanity, individuals, societies, and the environment.

                    <p class="intro">
                        Can money really buy happiness? Is time money, or is money the TIME? Let’s leave behind these cliché and tedious arguments because one thing we all do know is, it’s the time OF money. Call it the tyranny of capitalism or the ‘way of the world,’ it is what it is. The hustle isn’t for survival, wellbeing, or prosperity; it’s for the crispy greenback.
                    </p>
                
                    <p class="more" style="display: none;">
                        But the good thing here is that humanity has started to work on a sustainable and long-term approach… yes! Even in business! Better late than never, I guess. Young adults, like you and me, tend to struggle, amateurishly, in wise saving and spending of the buck. Then why not jump on a secure track, outperform inflation, have a regular income, with no blood, sweat, and tears!?
                        <br><br>
                        Folks, that’s what we call investing. And now, it comes in SUSTAINABLE! Your invested money will only add to the betterment of the economy. Does it hurt anybody? NO, it does NOT! And mind you, this is absolutely crucial for the upcoming years, as the tables have turned after potential investors have switched to sustainability flag-bearing companies. Must say, ‘a big brain’ moment. This is monumental and game-changing because you can start up, invest, and earn all those golds and diamonds, with a bonus philanthropist award! And you’ll be the first one to gain fulfillment from that… Sustainability is for your own good before anyone else. It benefits you equally as anyone else, so no matter what your mindset is, this form of investing will suit you perfectly.
                        <br><br>
                        But how? Where? What? Why? I’ve got your back. I don’t think that we have to debate anymore on ‘why sustainability is sprinkled in every little, big human activity,’ when we are on the verge of depleting all our natural resources: oil, fossil fuels, water, gas, within this century. I’m overstating actually; it’s expected to be way sooner than that. Like 45 years at most. Not so far, right?
                        <br><br>
                        Coming back, businesses now tend to follow the ‘Economic, social, governance’ criteria (ESG), or as imposed on them for the better good. Investors emphasizing on positive behavior and operational changes influence mighty companies, corporations, and policy makers; they collectively tend to take ethical decisions, creating positive externalities in an economy.
                        <br><br>
                        For instance, aiming to minimize the ‘carbon footprint’ that a company ‘stamps’ on the ecosystem, the carbon emission it produces, maintaining pleasant working conditions for its stakeholders and employees, and moving towards biodiversity, renewable energy usage to consider broader social and environmental aspects.
                        <br><br>
                        Unlike traditional investments aimed at short-term returns, sustainable investing considers a holistic range of additional objectives, and investors are rapidly opting to associate with high ESG criteria score companies (and so should you) because they tend to carry secure prospects, reputable public image, low risk of failure, and higher potential of significant returns to shareholders. They avoid volatility in their portfolios as they’re tremendously supported by mighty social groups, especially the government.
                        <br><br>
                        What does this have to do with a student like you and me? It has a LOT to do actually. Future is finance. We are the future. Then invest, but sustainably… Companies like Nvidia (producer of GPUs and robotic structures), Microsoft, Adobe, Idexx laboratories, have attained the ‘golden score’ in 2023 for amazingly balancing business goals with ethical and moral principles to create a better world.
                        <br><br>
                        You know what Elon Musk says about ESG? “It’s the devil.” Tesla has a 37/100 ESG score due to racism, poor business conduct, and inadequate carbon strategy existing in the company. And GUESS WHAT? You’ll be stunned to know that Phillip Morris Cigarettes Manufacturer Int. has a 87/100! The irony is mind-bending… or blowing, to be fairly honest! I mean, what’s the point of flag-bearing your visit to Mars if you cannot maintain basic humanitarian standards, or create a minimum difference on Earth.
                        <br><br>
                        I wonder how difficult it must be to bring such enormous change for a man who has been titled the ‘richest man on planet earth.’ Not so rich at heart, huh? Nevertheless, considering investing and non-financial factors revolving around it is a ‘megamind’ strategy, which ensures a safe future for all of us. Come on now, for how long will you stay in denial that ‘I’ll see what comes tomorrow,’ when the chances of a bearable tomorrow are fading like anything.
                        <br><br>
                        The crux of the matter is that we all have to save sensibly, spend wisely, and invest sustainably. Especially when you’re hanging on a thin thread of the economy, like one in Pakistan. Start climbing those stocks and stacks of ‘good’ money, do some good for yourself, greater good for society, and the best good for your next generation. Trust me, they’ll thank you later. A day late and a dollar short. The world is your playground, when will you start playing...
